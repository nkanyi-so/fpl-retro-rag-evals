# fpl-retro-rag-evals

A case study in **eval methodology** for retrieval-augmented decision support.
The RAG is the substrate; the evals are the point.

## Thesis

Most RAG evals stop at "did we retrieve plausible-looking chunks?" — a judge scoring
relevance in a vacuum. This project's differentiator is an **outcome-grounded,
decision-quality eval**: did the retrieved context actually lead to a *better decision*
than a baseline, measured against what really happened?

The testbed is a retrospective RAG over the completed 2025–26 Premier League season,
answering one decision type — **captaincy** ("who should I captain in GW N?"). Because
the season is over, every decision has a ground-truth outcome (the points that captain
actually scored), so we can grade the system on results, not vibes.

### Status (honest)

- ✅ **Retrieval-eval layer — built this session.** Are the right chunks fetched?
  Plus a few code assertions and one LLM-as-judge for answer quality.
- 🚧 **Decision-quality eval — in progress (next session).** Did retrieved context
  produce more captain points than a baseline? This is the headline deliverable; the
  retrieval layer is the foundation it stands on.

## Critical invariant — temporal integrity

Any document used to decide gameweek N must contain only information available
*before GW N's deadline*. No hindsight leakage. Every corpus note is date-stamped and
frozen to a pre-deadline date, and retrieval applies a metadata filter (`date < GW
deadline`) at query time. This is enforced in code and covered by an assertion, not
assumed. The invariant is also why the vector store is **Chroma** — see
[Architecture](#architecture).

## This session's slice

- ONE decision type: captaincy.
- Corpus: ~10–15 short, clean, date-stamped gameweek notes (`data/corpus/`, `.md`).
- Embeddings: local, via sentence-transformers.
- Vector store: **Chroma** (native metadata filtering at query time).
- Generation + LLM-as-judge: Anthropic API.

## Architecture

Vector store is **Chroma**, not FAISS. The temporal-integrity invariant requires
metadata filtering at query time (return only chunks whose `date` precedes GW N's
deadline). Chroma supports `where` filters on metadata natively; FAISS is a pure
similarity index with no metadata predicate. The eval invariant drives the
architecture choice.

## The Problem

## Eval Methodology
### Retrieval eval
### Code assertions
### LLM-as-judge
### Decision-quality eval (next session)

## Failure Modes Found
